# Bangalore-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction


## Description

This project aims to predict real estate prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical real estate data, the project builds a predictive model to estimate property prices based on various features such as location, size, and type of property.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing from real estate datasets.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Implementation and training of various machine learning models.
- Evaluation of model performance with appropriate metrics.
- Visualization of predictions and insights.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies

Install the required packages using pip:

## Setup
Clone the repository:
Place your real estate dataset in the appropriate directory or adjust the file path in the scripts.
Run the data preprocessing script:
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA):
Train machine learning models:
Evaluate the models and generate performance reports:
(Optional) Visualize predictions and insights:

## Usage
Data Preprocessing: Prepare the real estate dataset for modeling by running the preprocess_data.py script.
This step includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand trends and relationships between variables using eda.py.
Model Training: Train various machine learning models to predict property prices with train_models.py.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using evaluate_models.py. This includes calculating metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
Visualization: Generate visualizations of predictions and insights from the model using visualize_results.py.
Results: Results, performance reports, and visualizations will be saved in the results/ and visualizations/ folders, respectively.
